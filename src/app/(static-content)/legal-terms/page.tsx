                <li>
                    The Design is your own original work and does not contain
                    any trademarks, logos, copyrighted material, any other
                    intellectual property belonging to any third party, or

                <li>
                    The Design does not infringe any rights (including but not
                    limited to copyright) of any third party.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is a legal, binding agreement. You represent and
                    warrant that you have the full right, power and authority to
                    enter into this agreement, agree to the Design Submission
                    Terms and Conditions, and that your agreement to them does
                    not violate any other agreement you have entered into with a
                    third party. If you have entered into an agreement with any
                    third party concerning the Design you must advise Campus
                    Flavor immediately by emailing: contact@campusflavor.com.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As between you and Campus Flavor, you own and will maintain
                    ownership of the Design. Campus Flavor does not and will not
                    own the Design because of your submission of the Design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By submitting the Design, you hereby grant Campus Flavor a
                    worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, right and license to
                    use, upload, modify, reproduce, copy, exhibit, create
                    derivative works of, distribute, sell, advertise, and
                    display the Design, in any manner now known or hereafter
                    devised. This license may be sub-licensed by Campus Flavor
                    to others. You waive any “moral rights” you may have in the
                    Design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You also grant Campus Flavor a worldwide, irrevocable,
                    non-exclusive, right and license to use, portray, display
                    and publish your name, appearance, voice, likeness,
                    photographic image, and biographical information, in any and
                    all media now known or hereafter devised. This license may
                    be sub-licensed by Campus Flavor to others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You also understand that Campus Flavor will market and
                    advertise the Design to the public, and obtain orders from
                    customers for the purchase of products featuring the Design.
                    Campus Flavor will, and will arrange for third parties to,
                    fulfill customer orders by facilitating payment for the
                    manufacture, distribution, and delivery of products
                    featuring the Design.

                <li>
                    Campus Flavor understands that circumstances may change and
                    recognizes that, on a rare occasion, you may need to request
                    a revocation of one or both of the irrevocable licenses you
                    granted to Campus Flavor in paragraphs 5 and 6 above (the
                    “Non-Exclusive License(s)”). On such a rare occasion you can
                    make this request by emailing contact@campusflavor.com. Your
                    e-mail must have "Request for Revocation" in the subject
                    line and explain the basis for the request. You understand
                    and agree that Campus Flavor is not obligated to revoke a
                    Non-Exclusive License and that, if Campus Flavor does revoke
                    a Non-Exclusive License, it may do so with certain
                    conditions, for example, preserving its or its sub-licensees
                    right to sell through any items bearing the Design, and
                    advertise and promote the same, until all inventory is
                    exhausted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Campus Flavor also may terminate the Non-Exclusive Licenses
                    by providing written notice to you, at the email address
                    provided by you, of Campus Flavor’s election to terminate a
                    Non-Exclusive License. Upon such notice, the Non-Exclusive
                    Licenses shall terminate; provided, however, Campus Flavor
                    and any sub-licensees and wholesale parties that sell the
                    Design under Campus Flavor’s authorization, may, at their
                    discretion, sell through any items in their possession
                    bearing the Design and advertise and promote the same, until
                    such time as the inventory of such products is exhausted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Campus Flavor may offer to sell or sublicense your artwork
                    outside of CampusFlavor.com, such as in offline retail. In
                    such circumstances, the terms of those sales will be subject
                    to a separate retail license agreement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On certain limited occasions Campus Flavor may include the
                    Design in miscellaneous items such as, without limitation,
                    calendars or books that promote the Campus Flavor brand or
                    community, and Artist will not be owed or paid any amounts
                    or payments for such use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On certain occasions, Campus Flavor may award a cash prize
                    (and/or other prize(s)) when the Design is submitted in a
                    Design Competition and selected as a winning design.
                    Information regarding any such prize will be published on
                    CampusFlavor.com. Payment of any cash prize will be on the
                    same terms and conditions as, and subject to your agreement
                    to, these Design Submission Terms and Conditions as well as
                    the official contest rules that apply to that Design
                    Competition.

                    Campus Flavor’s use of the Design and its payments to you
                    are subject to your representation that you own the Design
                    and that the Design does not infringe any third party’s

                    You alone will be responsible for the payment of any tax
                    that arises as a result of receiving any payment from Campus
                    Flavor, its subsidiaries, related companies, partners, or
                    licensors.

                    Pursuant to applicable U.S. law, payments under these Design

                    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Campus
                    Flavor, including Campus Flavor’s sublicensees (each an

                    the Design (including reproducing, distributing, adapting,
                    and displaying the Design) and/or a breach or alleged breach
                    of the Design Submission Terms and Conditions by you.
                </li>
                <li>

                    You acknowledge that Campus Flavor may decline to render its
                    services to you in connection with the Design by, for
                    example, deciding not to market or advertise the Design, or
                    taking down the Design from CampusFlavor.com, and that this
                    can be done for any reason, at any time, and in Campus
                    Flavor’s sole discretion. You agree that the decisions of
                    Campus Flavor are final and binding.

                    Campus Flavor may, in its discretion, change these Design
                    Submission Terms and Conditions at any time and such changes
                    shall be effective immediately and incorporated into this
                    Agreement. It is your responsibility to review any changes
                    to the Design Submission Terms and Conditions. No
                    modification of this Agreement shall be binding unless
