                    As part of our tracking utility, we have implemented Google
                    Analytics and Microsoft Clarity reports. These reports use
                    the same technology that informs targeted advertising.
                    Campus Flavor uses this non-personally identifiable
                    information to understand our audience better and inform
                    communication and strategy decisions for our business.
                    Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics using Google Ads
                    Settings, which will also opt the visitor out of
                    non-personally identifiable demographic and interest
                    tracking. Visitors can also take greater control of their
                    privacy preferences through Google Analytics&#39; currently
                    available opt-outs for the web.

                    If you click on a link to a third party site, including on
                    an advertisement, you will leave CampusFlavor.com and go to
                    the site you selected. Because we cannot control the
                    activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility
                    for any use of your personally identifiable information by
                    such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will
                    adhere to the same privacy practices as CampusFlavor.com. We
                    encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other

                    CampusFlavor.com may use web beacons in connection with
                    emails sent to CampusFlavor.com users, to let us know

                    Our third party advertising partner employs a software
                    technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),
                    that help us better manage content on our site by informing
                    us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics
                    with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
                    and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In
                    contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer
                    hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages
                    and are about the size of the period at the end of this
                    sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear
                    gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

                    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
                    the personally identifiable information submitted to us,
                    both during transmission and once we receive it. No method
                    of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
                    storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive
                    to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                    personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                    security.

                    that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
