                    If, within 10 business days of our receipt of your counter
                    notice, the party who submitted the initial copyright claim
                    doesn&#39;t inform us of an action seeking a court order
                    against you, the material specified in the counter notice
                    may be reactivated. Reactivating the material before this
                    time may result in account termination. If you have any
                    questions or concerns, please consult an attorney. You may
                    also consider communicating directly with the party who
                    filed the initial infringement claim.
